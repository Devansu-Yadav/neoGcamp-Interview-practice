    Hello there, I am Devansu Yadav, a 3rd year CS Engineering student studying at the University Of Mumbai.<br> I am a passionate self-learner, who loves exploring different technologies and build projects that actually solve a problem. I am mainly focussed in Web Development, and I love building web apps❤️. <br> I love contributing to Open Source, participating in hackathons and learn something new everyday to become a better version of myself! I am also quite active in many global Tech communities since that helps me network with many people, and also helps me improve on my soft skills. <br> I also write blogs since I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with the community and it helps me gain a deeper understanding of any concept!

<h1 align="center">Why do I want to get into neoG</h1>

    <font size="4">
    - So far, in my Dev journey, I have been exploring different technologies throughout and I realized that I am passionate about Web Dev, but I have felt that I really need a mentor, who can guide me in a direction, with whom I can share my learnings, my success and my failures. <br>
    - Getting mentored would really help me learn better, and be prepared for any upcoming challenges/opportunities in Tech. <br>
    - Hence, I see neoGcamp as a great learning opportunity to strengthen my skills in Web Dev and become a Full stack Developer, to get mentored in such a motivated environment with so many passionate students, and also give a direction to my career! <br>
